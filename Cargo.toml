## Uses the #[doc(feature(...))] functionality to clearly show in the generated documentation
## which feature of this crate is needed for each type and function to be available.
## This increases discoverability of features massively.
## To use this locally, run: `RUSTDOCFLAGS="--cfg docsrs" cargo doc --features kem`.
